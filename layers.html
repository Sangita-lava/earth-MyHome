                    The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, consisting of a thin, rigid layer that plays a vital role in Earth's geology. 
                    It is divided into two main types: continental crust, which is older and thicker, and oceanic crust, which is younger and denser. 
                    The crust is essential for understanding plate tectonics and the dynamic processes of the Earth.

                    The mantle is the mostly solid bulk of Earth's interior, lying between the dense, super-heated core and the thin outer layer, the crust. 
                    It is about 2,900 kilometers (1,802 miles) thick and constitutes approximately 84 percent of Earth’s total volume. 
                    The mantle is composed of silicate rock and minerals, and it plays a crucial role in geological processes such as plate tectonics and volcanic activity.

                    The outer core is a layer of liquid iron and nickel located beneath the mantle and surrounding the inner core. 
                    It is about 2,200 kilometers (1,367 miles) thick and is responsible for generating Earth's magnetic field through the movement of its molten metals. 
                    The outer core's intense heat and fluid motion play a crucial role in the dynamics of our planet's interior.

                    The inner core is the Earth's deepest layer, composed primarily of solid iron and nickel. 
                    Despite extremely high temperatures, it remains solid due to immense pressure. 
                    The inner core is about 1,220 kilometers (760 miles) thick and plays a key role in maintaining Earth's magnetic field. 
                    Its unique properties help scientists understand the dynamic processes occurring deep within our planet.
